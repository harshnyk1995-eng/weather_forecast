Graceful error handling for invalid locations or API failures.

Simple, responsive UI built with Railsâ€™ default views.

Technologies Used:

Ruby on Rails 8

Geocoder gem for geolocation

HTTParty for API requests

Clone the repository.

Add your OpenWeather API key in credentials.yml.enc:

  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY


Run migrations (if any) and start the Rails server:

rails server
